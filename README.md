## A simple desktop login and registration system developed 
in C++ using Object Oriented Programming that stores the users 
information in a database. It allows the users to create unique 
accounts and login in once they are created. Developed using Qt 
framework because it is powerful and compartible with C++.

> This particular project was developed using Qt framework. The purpose
was to practice developed using Object Oriented Programming and mastery 
of C++ classes. 

> The second goal of the project was to test database connectivity and 
learn how the framework interacts with my code. l solved a registration 
problem where if a user's login details don't match the ones stored in the
database, access is denied.
